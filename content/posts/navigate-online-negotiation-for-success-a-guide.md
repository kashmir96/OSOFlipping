## A Guide to Succeeding in Online Negotiation

Negotiating online can be a great way to make extra income, but not everyone has the skillset to effectively navigate and come out on top. That's why having a guide to help you successfully navigate online negotiation can be so beneficial. This guide will breakdown the steps you need to take and tips to help ensure success. 

The first step is to research your target. You want to ensure you know who you are negotiating with, what their status is, and their level of experience. Knowing your target’s background will allow you to craft your negotiation more effectively. You should also be aware of your target’s current situation. This can be done through research or asking them questions. Knowing any financial hardships they may be experiencing can be used to your advantage when negotiating.

The next step is to set realistic goals and expectations. You should have an understanding of what a fair outcome would be for both parties involved. Having an idea of what you’re ultimately trying to achieve will help you craft the perfect offer. Don’t try to get too greedy and be realistic when it comes to what your target can offer. 

When negotiating online, you should also be aware of when to back off and stop the negotiation. Knowing when to walk away is a crucial step to success. If you get the feeling the negotiation is going south or you aren’t getting anything out of it, don’t be afraid to take a step back.

Lastly, it is important to have a backup plan in the event things don’t go your way. Having a backup plan allows you to walk away with something even in the worst situations. Don’t feel defeated if the negotiation doesn’t go as planned. 

Navigating online negotiation successfully can be tricky but it doesn’t have to be. By following this guide and utilizing the tips mentioned above, anyone looking to make some extra money on the side can become proficient in online negotiation.
