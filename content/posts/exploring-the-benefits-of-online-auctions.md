With minimal overhead costs, no goods to store or ship, and no prior knowledge necessary to get started, online auctions can provide a great way to turn a profit with minimal effort. 

Online auctions typically involve individuals buying and selling items to the highest bidder. Items can range from goods like electronics, books and furniture, to specialty items like art, jewelry, or antiques. Participants can bid on items in real time at auction houses that are located around the world, and the advantage of purchasing goods this way is both the potential to win them at a reduced price, and to take advantage of the rarity of some of the items that can be found. 

The convenience of online auctions make them attractive to not only those just looking to make extra money on the side, but even to those looking to replace their regular income from full-time jobs. They offer the potential to make repeat business and establish a return customer base, which can turn a profit quickly.
